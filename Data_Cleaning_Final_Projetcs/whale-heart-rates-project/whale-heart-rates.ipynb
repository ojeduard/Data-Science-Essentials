    "# Blue Whale Heart Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "By how much do blue whale heart rates change when they dive down to find food? \n",
    "\n",
    "The file `blue-whale-heart-rates.csv` contains heart rate data (measured in beats per minute) for blue whales. The data captures the dynamics of their heart rates as they dive over one hundred meters deep to forage for food. The heart rate measurements are taken approximately every 10 seconds during 8 separate dives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dive Phases\n",
    "The data records the heart rates corresponding to different dive states:\n",
    "1. Descent: The whale begins its dive, descending into the depths.\n",
    "2. Lunging: The whale opens its mouth and lunges upward, engulfing prey and water.\n",
    "3. Filtering: After lunging, the whale sinks slightly and filters out water to retain food.\n",
    "4. Ascent: The whale returns to the surface to breathe, marking the end of a dive.\n",
    "5.  Surface: The blue whale is now on the surface (upper 5 meters)\n",
    "\n",
    "The lunging and filtering process may occur multiple times on a single dive. The next dive cycle begins with another descent."
