    "Can you estimate how toxic a poison dart frog is based on its brightness?\n",
    "\n",
    "Poison dart frogs are small, colorful frogs from Central and South America. They're famous for their toxic skin, which some indigenous people use for blow darts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists studied the connection between the bright colors and toxicity of the poison dart frog **Dendrobates pumilio**. While they're usually red with blue legs, they can be found in about 15 different colors in Panama.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `frog-reflectance.csv` contains the average brightness (from 0 to 1) of 10 frog populations, measured on both the back and belly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `frog-toxicity.csv` provides a `toxicity` score (from 0 to 1) for 48 frogs from the same 10 populations. Toxicity was tested by injecting frog skin extracts into mice and recording how long it took them to fall back asleep. Longer times suggest higher `toxicity`."
